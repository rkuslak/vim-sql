Attempts to provide SQL Server browsing, symbol completion, and arbirary
query execution to Vim and NeoVIM via a plesant interface for limited
values of "plesant."

Some effort has been made to keep it a general and plugable as possible,
as eventual addition of other engines (such as Postgre or MariaDB) is a
long-term goal, after a first-class MS SQL experience is created.
